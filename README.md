## Description
- This is the repo for my personal website.
- It is a static site hosted on Google Cloud Platform.
- It will continue to grow as I continue to build things.
## Design
- I was inspired by simplicity and Ron Swanson. ("Man. Most Eggs.")
- I was more concerned with getting my site live as quickly as possible; fretting over the design can sometimes slow me down. So I kept the design simple.
## To do
1. Think of more updates to make
1. Add tests for the 404 page
